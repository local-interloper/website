aboutMe:
  A nerdy guy with a nack for all things tech. Started programming from a rather young age (8) so that pretty much
  cemented my life path. Ever since I did some BASIC on that old Win 95 rig, I've been working learning and improving
  at making rocks think. That spawned numerous projects that often happen to be interesting conversation topics.

hobbies:
  description:
    As a kid I always liked the idea of making video games. Chasing that goal taught me various valuable skills some of
    which I would later make a career out of or turn into hobbies. That would primarily be programming, but other skills 
    I've developed also play a key role in both my career path and development of my hobbies.

    It should come as no surprise that on my journey, I've used a variety of tools to achive all my goals.
    While trying to get into game development I had to learn about programming, 3D modelling, animation, and whatnot.
    That resulted in me getting familiar with a wide range of creation oriented software.
